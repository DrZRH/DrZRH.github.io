I am a Ph.D. graduate from **[Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/)**, advised by [Prof. Jun Sun](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/sun-jun-6816). My research focuses on **Trustworthy AI**, with a specific emphasis on certifying the robustness, fairness, and privacy of deep learning systems. I leverage **formal methods** and **empirical analysis** to develop reliable and secure AI solutions.

My work has been published in top-tier conferences and journals including **AAAI**, **OOPSLA**, **CAV**, and **IEEE TR**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical AI deployment, ensuring that AI systems are safe, fair, and trustworthy.
